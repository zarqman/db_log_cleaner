History
-------
This plugin was originally released by Sergey Kojin. I have extended it to 
filter more PostgreSQL logs as well as to filter MySQL's logs. Sergey did not 
include any contact information so I decided to release this directly, but to 
rename it to avoid any confusion. Many thanks to Sergey for conceiving of this
plugin and making it available. I'm sure extending it was easier than the 
initial implementation so credit goes to Sergey.

What is it
----------
A basic plugin that will automatically skip logging of PostgreSQL and MySQL 
queries about the schema. These only show up in development mode by default, 
but they can become annoying.

Installation
------------
Simply add this plugin into your rails app.

To add to your rails app:
  ./script/plugin install -x http://svn.iprog.com/projects/rails/plugins/db_log_cleaner
(drop the -x if you don't use subversion in your project or don't want to 
manage plugins via svn:externals)

Contact
-------
You may contact me with any questions, enhancements, complaints, etc. Sergey, 
if you find this, please feel free to roll this into your original plugin if 
you want.

----- Original README ------

PostgreLogCleaner
=================

Make ActiveRecord logs more short and clean by removing system SQL logs lines.
That actually only for PostgreSQL.

Example of Removed Log Line
=======

 SQL (0.000000)    SELECT a.attname, format_type(a.atttypid, a.atttypmod), d.adsrc, a.attnotnull
 FROM pg_attribute a LEFT JOIN pg_attrdef d
 ON a.attrelid = d.adrelid AND a.attnum = d.adnum
 WHERE a.attrelid = 'categories'::regclass
 AND a.attnum > 0 AND NOT a.attisdropped
 ORDER BY a.attnum
